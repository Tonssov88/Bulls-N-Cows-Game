# Bulls-N-Cows-Game
This is my first repository on Git Hub. 
In this game, the player(you) tries to guess the computer's 4 digit number which has no repeated digits. After each guess, the computer will tell you how many digits from your guess is in their secret number, represented as "cows". If an digit is in the right place, it is called a "bull". With this info, you need to narrow down all options. 

Example: 
If the player guesses "6720" and the secret number is 9742, the feedback from the computer will be "There was 1 bull(s) and 1 cow(s)" as the 7 was in the right place, while the 2 was in the secret number but not in the correct spot.
