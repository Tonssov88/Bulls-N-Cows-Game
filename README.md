# Bulls-N-Cows-Game
This is my first repository on Git Hub. 
In this game, the player (you) tries to guess the computer's 4 digit number which has no repeated digits and can't start with a 0 (that would make it a 3-digit number). After each guess, the computer will tell you how many digits from your guess are in the secret number, called as "cows" but if a digit is also in the right place, it is called a "bull". With this info, you need to guess the number, preferably in as little turns as possible. 

Example: 
If the player guesses 6720 and the secret number is 9742, the feedback from the computer will be "There was 1 bull(s) and 1 cow(s)" since the 7 was in the right place, while the 2 was in the secret number but not in the correct place.
